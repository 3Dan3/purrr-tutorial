## Abstract

Happy R users purrr: using functional programming to solve iteration problems

Code with a lot of duplication is harder to understand, troubleshoot and maintain. The goal of this tutorial is help you remove duplication in your code by using functions that write `for` loops for you.

You'll learn to use the functions in the `purrr` package to perform iterative tasks: tasks that look like "for each _____ do _____".

By the end of the tutorial you'll be writing code that is more readable and easier to update and you'll be ready to solve new iteration problems faster and with fewer mistakes.
